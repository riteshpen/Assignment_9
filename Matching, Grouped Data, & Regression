# Question 1

## Part A

```{r}
turnout <- read.csv("turnout.csv")

contingency_table <- xtabs(~ GOTV_call + voted1998, data = turnout)

prop_table <- prop.table(contingency_table, margin = 2)

print(prop_table)

recieve_GOTV_call_voted_98 <- prop_table[2,2]
no_recieve_GOTV_call_voted_98 <- prop_table[1,2]

print(recieve_GOTV_call_voted_98)
print(no_recieve_GOTV_call_voted_98)


prop.test(GOTV_call ~ voted1998, data=turnout)




```

## Part B

```{r}
age_groups <- cut(turnout$AGE, breaks = c(18, 30, 45, 60, Inf),
                  labels = c("18-30", "31-45", "46-60", "61+"),
                  right = FALSE)


table(turnout$voted1996, by=turnout$GOTV_call)
table(age_groups, by=turnout$GOTV_call)
table(turnout$MAJORPTY, turnout$GOTV_call)

turnout <- transform(turnout, age_groups = cut(AGE, breaks = c(18, 30, 45, 60, Inf),
                                               labels = c("18-30", "31-45", "46-60", "61+"),
                                               right = FALSE))
turnout$age_groups <- factor(turnout$age_groups)

ggplot(turnout, aes(x = GOTV_call, y = AGE, fill = age_groups)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "GOTV Call", y = "Age", fill = "Age Groups")

turnout$MAJORPTY <- factor(turnout$MAJORPTY)

ggplot(turnout, aes(x=MAJORPTY, fill=GOTV_call)) + geom_bar(position = "dodge", 
                  stat = "count") +
 labs(x = "MAJORPTY", y = "GOTV_call",)

turnout$voted1996 <- factor(turnout$voted1996)

ggplot(turnout, aes(x=GOTV_call, fill=voted1996)) + geom_bar(position = "dodge", 
                  stat = "count") +
 labs(x = "voted1996", y = "GOTV Call")

```

## Part C

```{r}
model <- glm(GOTV_call ~ voted1996 + AGE + MAJORPTY, data=turnout, family="binomial")

matched_data <- matchit(GOTV_call ~ voted1996 + AGE + MAJORPTY, data = turnout, method = "nearest", ratio = 5)


summary(matched_data)

matched_dataset <- match.data(matched_data)


contingency_table <- table(matched_dataset$GOTV_call, matched_dataset$voted1998)

prop_table <- prop.table(contingency_table, margin = 2)
receive_GOTV_call_voted_98 <- prop_table[2, 2]
no_receive_GOTV_call_voted_98 <- prop_table[1, 2]

prop.test(GOTV_call ~ voted1998, data=matched_dataset)
```

The probability of receiving a government call and voted in the 1998 election is about double

of the probability of receiving a government call without voting in the 1998 election. In our

analysis, we considered three confounding variables: voting in 1996, age, and majorpty. 71

received a government call of those who did not in 1996 while 176 received a government call

while voting in 1996. The older the person is the more likely to person would receive a

government call. A person with majorpty is three times as likely to receive a government call

than someone without.

# Question 2

## Part A

```{r}
solder <- read.csv("solder.csv")

ggplot(solder, aes(x = Opening, y = skips)) +
                geom_boxplot(fill = "white", color = "black") +
                labs(title = "Relationship between Opening Size and Skips",
                     x = "Opening Size",
                     y = "Number of Skips")

ggplot(solder, aes(x = Solder, y = skips)) +
                geom_boxplot(fill = "white", color = "black") +
                labs(title = "Relationship between Solder Thickness and Skips",
                     x = "Solder Thickness",
                     y = "Number of Skips")


```

## Part B

```{r}
model <- lm(skips ~ Opening * Solder, data = solder)
coefficients <- coef(model) %>% 
  round(2)
confidence_intervals <- confint(model)

results_table <- cbind(coefficients, confidence_intervals)
rownames(results_table) <- c("Intercept", "OpeningMedium", "OpeningLarge", "SolderThin", "OpeningMedium:SolderThin", 
"OpeningLarge:SolderThin") 
colnames(results_table) <- c("Estimate", "Lower 95% CI", "Upper 95% CI")

print(results_table)


```

## Part C

y = 0.39 + 2.41 \* OpeningMedium + 5.13 \* OpeningLarge + 2.28 \* SolderThin - 0.74 \* OpeningMedium \* Solder Thin + 
9.65 \* OpeningLarge \* SolderThin

The baseline number of skips on the circuit board is most likely 0. The main effect of Opening Medium is 2.41 skips 
and the main effect of Opening Large and Solder Thin is 5.13 and 2.28 skips respectively. The interaction effect 
of Opening Medium and Solder Thin is -0.74 meaning when the size of the opening on the solder gun is medium and the 
thickness is thin, you would expect about 0.74 less skips. The interaction effecting of Opening Large and Solder Thin 
is 9.65 so when the size of opening of gun is large and thickness is then, you would expect 9.65 more skips.

## Part D

A large opening size and a thick thickness of the alloy. This combination will minimize the number of skips because 
the larger the opening size the fewer the number of skips and the thicker the fewer the number of skips and vise versa.
